## Description

This project was an exploration into creating immersive web experiences using **React Three Fiber**. The goal was to showcase my portfolio in a unique, cyberpunk-themed 3D environment.

I faced challenges in creating intuitive user interactions within a 3D space. To overcome this, I designed a hybrid 2D/3D UI for better usability. The projects and experience pages utilize a standard 2D web UI.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk-themed 3D environment**: Immerse yourself in a unique portfolio experience.
- **Hybrid 2D/3D User Interface**: Combines the best of both worlds for intuitive navigation.
- **Showcases Projects and Experience**: Detailed pages highlighting my work and skills.
